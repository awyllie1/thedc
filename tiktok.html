		<p>TikTok has consistently faced controversy due to its ownership by the Chinese corporation, ByteDance. As a multinational technology firm based in Beijing, ByteDance's affiliation with TikTok has sparked increased scrutiny amidst escalating tensions between China and the United States. This post will look at why Congress is worried about Chinese ownership from a technical standpoint and if they really should be.</p>
		<p>What is TikTok’s history in the United States and what political issues have arisen? TikTok is an incredibly popular social media platform that started as a much less popular app called Musical.ly. In November 2017, ByteDance spent nearly $1 billion to purchase Musical.ly, a small startup with offices in Shanghai and Santa Monica, California. The consolidation of Musical.ly into TikTok in August 2018 marked the beginning of TikTok’s reign as one of the most popular apps in the world. The acquisition of Musical.ly’s user base played a crucial role in this ascent, setting the stage for TikTok’s meteoric rise in the coming years. In the fourth quarter of 2019, TikTok became the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/14/most-downloaded-ios-app-2/">second-most</a> downloaded app in the US, right behind Disney+. The explosive popularity of the app led to the Federal Trade Commission opening an investigation into TikTok’s privacy policies in 2019 and whether they were illegally collecting data of users under 13 years old.</p>
		<p>Days later, the Trump administration announced that it was considering banning TikTok altogether in the United States. Trump wanted TikTok to divest its US operations to an American company, which led to bids from Microsoft and Walmart, who expressed interest in the possible acquisition.</p>
		<p>The Biden administration later got into the ring with TikTok, banning the use of the social media platform on all government devices in December 2021 after a wave of security concerns sparked from media reports. The ban disallowed the TikTok app on all US government devices, covering nearly 4 million government employees.</p>
		<p>On March 23rd, 2023, the CEO of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew testified in front of congress in a grueling five-hour hearing. Congress was focused on three main issues, Chinese spying, children’s access to the app, and data security. Many members had questions about ‘Project Texas’ asking if a project to move all of TikTok's US operations to Texas was even feasible. Ownership also came up, Mr. Chew pushed back against forcing ByteDance to divest its US operations saying, “I don’t think ownership is the issue here. With a lot of respect: American social companies don’t have a great record with privacy and data security. I mean, look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica…” Which makes a great headline, but does not meet the core issue that congress has been pushing on, who has access to American data?</p>
		<p>In July of 2022, Internet 2.0, an Australian/US-based company that gives social media apps a score based on how much data they can collect, rated TikTok based on their data collection. TikTok scored a 63.1%, the worst score a social media app has ever received. TikTok has access to device location, contacts, and persistent access to your calendar. TikTok is also able to retrieve all other running applications on your device, which may give ByteDance enough information to create a realistic diagram of a user’s device. The app also routinely asks for your contact information, and if denied, will continue to ask until the user grants permission. Most concerningly, TikTok can harvest the most information from Andriod devices. The device’s Wi-Fi SSID, SIM serial number, Integrated Circuit Card Identification Number, MAC Address and complete access to read the user’s clipboard are some of the most notable security concerns. Internet 2.0 concluded that TikTok needs hardly any of this data to function properly and led Internet 2.0 to believe that the sole purpose of the collection is for data harvesting.</p>
		<p>While it is true that every tech company collects user data, the biggest concerns about TikTok are more about who has access to that data and what they could do with it. Congress has a legitimate reason to be concerned about the security implications of a Chinese-owned company having access to Americans' data, and these concerns must be taken seriously. It is difficult to see the privacy practices changing, even if a US buyer does take over ByteDance’s US operations. China has repeatedly stated that it won’t approve a TikTok sale, calling it ‘extortion’, China Daily <a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202009/23/WS5f6a2445a31024ad0ba7b1c9.html">called</a> such a deal ‘dirty’, ‘unfair’, and based on ‘bullying and extortion.’ ByteDance has refused to hand over TikTok’s source code if a sale is forced by the US government, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3101362/tiktoks-algorithm-not-sale-bytedance-tells-us-source">stating</a>, “The car can be sold, but not the engine.” And without the source code, toning down fears of data harvesting by ByteDance and China would be improbable. The US government would have to find a roundabout way to regulate what information the app can collect.</p>
		<p>In addition to security concerns, there are also concerns about censorship on the platform. TikTok has been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/tiktok-insiders-say-chinese-parent-bytedance-in-control.html">accused</a> of censoring content that is critical of the Chinese government or its policies. This then led to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2020/07/25/beware-tiktok-really-is-spying-on-you-new-security-report-update-trump-pompeo-china-warning/?sh=1b537e8d4014">accusations</a> that TikTok is not a truly open platform and is being used to push Chinese propaganda.</p>
		<p>Critics of a potential TikTok ban present an alternative viewpoint, contending that prohibiting the platform could negatively impact American businesses by eliminating a crucial advertising and marketing channel. TikTok has proven to be a highly effective medium for engaging younger American audiences, granting businesses access to both their attention and purchasing power. Nevertheless, the primary concern revolves around the fact that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. Opponents caution that imposing a ban on the app might result in diplomatic and trade repercussions. They argue that such a move could strain US-China relations and provoke retaliatory actions against American enterprises operating in China. Moreover, a TikTok ban could inadvertently stifle creativity and limit the global exchange of ideas and culture, potentially reducing opportunities for cross-cultural understanding and collaboration.</p>
		<p>A TikTok ban could see a potential impact on freedom of expression and the digital economy. Banning TikTok may set a precedent for censorship, limiting the diversity of voices and perspectives available online. This, in turn, could hinder innovation and the development of new ideas, as the free flow of information is a cornerstone of a thriving digital ecosystem.</p>
		<p>In summary, TikTok has been a topic of controversy due to its Chinese ownership, with concerns raised over data security and potential influence on American users. It seems the heat the US government is bringing is warranted until ByteDance can prove unequivocally that China has no control over them. The implications of a Chinese-owned company having access to Americans’ data continue to be far-reaching and will be a point of concern for years to come. Critics argue that many companies already have that data and a potential ban could negatively impact American businesses and freedom of expression. The debate surrounding TikTok highlights the challenges faced by governments and tech companies as they navigate issues of privacy, security, risk, and international relations in the digital age.</p>
